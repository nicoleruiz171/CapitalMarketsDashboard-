# Capital Markets Dashboard - Enhanced ETL & AWS Integration  
This project is a **dynamic capital markets dashboard** that integrates **Yahoo Finance and FRED API** data, performs **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, and visualizes **bond prices, returns, volatility, and yield data**. It also features **AWS S3 integration** to store processed data for cloud accessibility.  

## 🚀 How It's Made
### 🛠️ Technologies Used
**• Programming Language**: Python  
**• Libraries**: ```yfinance```, ```pandas```, ```matplotlib```, ```numpy```, ```requests```, ```boto3```, ```ipywidgets```  
**• APIs**: Yahoo Finance, FRED API  
**• Cloud Storage**: AWS S3  
**• Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

This project follows an **ETL pipeline**:  
**1. Extract** – Fetches bond price data from **Yahoo Finance** and historical yield data from **FRED API**.  
**2. Transform** – Cleans data, calculates **cumulative returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio**.  
**3. Load** – Stores results as **CSV files** and uploads them to **AWS S3** for cloud access.  

Interactive **Jupyter Notebook widgets** allow users to select bonds, set a date range, and dynamically update data.

## 📊 Tickers and What They Represent
This dashboard analyzes **three U.S. Treasury bond ETFs**, each representing different **maturity durations**:  
| Ticker | ETF Name                            | Bond Type                            | Risk Level |
| :---:  | :---:                               | :---:                                | :---:      |
| SHY    | iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF  | Short-term bonds (1-3 years)         |  Low       |
| IEF    | iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF | Intermediate-term bonds (7-10 years) |  Medium    |
| TLT    | iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF  | Long-term bonds (20+ years)          |  High      |

**Why does this matter?**  
• Short-term bonds (**SHY**) are **less sensitive** to interest rate changes.  
• Long-term bonds (**TLT**) **fluctuate more** but offer higher yield potential.  
**• Investors choose bonds based on risk tolerance and market outlook**.  

## 📈 Financial Metrics Calculated and Their Importance
### 1️⃣ Volatility  
**📌 What it measures**: The fluctuation in bond prices over time.  
**📌 Why it matters**: Investors seeking stability prefer **low-volatility** assets.  
### 2️⃣ Sharpe Ratio  
**📌 What it measures**: **Risk-adjusted returns** (return per unit of risk).  
**📌 Why it matters**: Higher Sharpe ratios indicate **better investment returns relative to risk**.  
### 3️⃣ Cumulative Returns  
**📌 What it measures**: **Total returns** on the investment over time.  
**📌 Why it matters**: Investors can track performance and **compare bond investments**.  
### 4️⃣ Historical Yield Data (FRED API)  
**📌 What it measures**: U.S. Treasury yields over time for different maturities.  
**📌 Why it matters**: Helps investors understand **interest rate trends** and their impact on bond prices.  

## 💡 Real-Life Applications for Investors
🔹 Compare different bond ETFs to assess **risk vs. return**.  
🔹 Analyze **bond price reactions** to interest rate changes.  
🔹 Identify **optimal entry and exit points** for bond investments.  
🔹 Use the **Sharpe ratio** to compare bond investments with other asset classes.  
🔹 Make **data-driven investment decisions** for portfolio diversification.  

## ⚡ How to Run the Code
### 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:    
**• Python 3.x**  
**• Jupyter Notebook**  
• Required Python libraries (install using the command below)  
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib numpy boto3 requests ipywidgets
```
### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capital-markets-dashboard.git  
cd capital-markets-dashboard
```
### 3️⃣ Set Up API Keys  
Before running the code, update your API credentials in the script:  
```python
FRED_API_KEY = 'YOUR_FRED_API_KEY' 
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'  
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY'  
S3_BUCKET = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the notebook file and **run all cells** to start the dashboard.
